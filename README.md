# Akanda Appliance

*Part of the [Akanda Project](https://github.com/dreamhost/akanda).*

Router appliance based upon [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) and [Packet
Filter](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/). Includes a REST API to monitor,
configure, and manage the router.

Akanda routers are recommended to run with 512 MB of RAM and a single vCPU, and
are intended to run within an virtualized L2 overlay to provide complete network
virtualization.
